    "best; some people use a plastic sweater box. [17] 6 Clean up urine and feces with an enzymatic cleaner. When the\n",
    "cat fails to use its litter box, clean the area with an enzymatic cleaner designed for cat urine (or a 10% solution\n",

    "preferences and add new boxes in the areas it's using as a bathroom. Clearly this isn't ideal if your cat is using\n",
    "the center of the living room rug, but it's worth considering if the cat is soiling an out-of-the-way corner of\n",

    "have to resort to a slower transition. For example, if your cat prefers to urinate on carpet, place a piece of\n",
    "similar carpet in the litter box. If the cat is willing to use that option, add a small amount of litter on top of\n",
    "the carpet the next day. Continue adding more litter and replacing the carpet when it gets too dirty, until the cat\n",
    "is transitioned to litter completely. You may have to confine the cat to a non-carpeted area of the house for a\n",

    "stress from changes in their environment or schedule. Your cat may stop using the litterbox after a person or other\n",
    "animal leaves the household, or when a new one moves in. Some cats even respond badly to redecoration. Here are a\n",
    "few ways to help: Provide private places where the cat can be on its own, including hiding spots and high perches.\n",
    "If your cat is allowed outside, let it come and go whenever it likes. [27] Let your cat initiate contact, and be\n",
    "calm and consistent in your response. Some cats are stressed because they aren't getting enough playtime, while\n",
    "others dislike being pet or picked up whenever the owner feels like it. If the cat's behavior continues, consult a\n",
    "veterinarian or animal behaviorist. Provide private places where the cat can be on its own, including hiding spots\n",
    "and high perches. If your cat is allowed outside, let it come and go whenever it likes. [27] Let your cat initiate\n",

    "playtime, while others dislike being pet or picked up whenever the owner feels like it. If the cat's behavior\n",
    "continues, consult a veterinarian or animal behaviorist. 3 Respond to vertical spraying. If your cat backs up\n",
    "against a vertical surface, wiggles its tail, and releases a spray of urine, your cat is spraying. If you don't see\n",
    "it in action, look for roundish areas of strong-smelling urine a little higher up than the height of your cat's\n",
    "rear end, with streak marks running down to the baseboard or floor. Any cat can perform this territorial behavior,\n",
    "but it is most common in unneutered, male cats. Here's how to respond if your cat is spraying: Spraying is often a\n",

    "especially if you cannot find a solution. 4 Replace small boxes as a kitten grows. If you adopted your cat as a\n",
    "kitten, it may need a larger litter box once it grows up. The cat should be able to turn around comfortably, and\n",
    "still be able to find a clean spot if you miss a cleanup. [30] Cats dislike change, and may take a while to adapt\n",
    "to the new box. Follow the instructions above if problems continue. Cats dislike change, and may take a while to\n",
    "adapt to the new box. Follow the instructions above if problems continue. 5 Clip away matted fur in long-haired\n",
    "cats . Some long-haired cats dirty the fur around their rear when they eliminate. This can cause painful or\n",
    "unpleasant experiences that the cat learns to associate with the litter box. If you notice this happening,\n",
    "carefully clip away matted fur from the area. [31] 6 Minimize damage when the owner is away. Some cats react poorly\n",
    "when their owner is away. They may try to urinate somewhere with a strong scent of the owner, usually the bed.\n",
    "Instruct the pet sitter to keep the bedroom door shut, and provide extra litter boxes so the cat can always reach\n",
    "one without walking by the pet sitter. [32] If possible, hire a pet sitter the cat already knows, or at least\n",
    "introduce them before you leave. If possible, hire a pet sitter the cat already knows, or at least introduce them\n",
    "before you leave. 7 Improve behavior in multi-pet households. Urine marking is a common reaction to conflict with\n",
    "another cat or dog, which can happen even if the animals got along in the past. For best results, make sure each\n",
    "animal can access resources without approaching the other: [33] Keep one litter box for each animal, plus one\n",
    "extra. Put each one in a separate location with at least two exit routes if possible. Give each animal its own bed\n",

    "the other animal, try a stricter method of separation. This is often necessary when bringing a new cat into the\n",

    "the other. Consult a cat behaviorist if the cats simply can't get along. Method 3 1 Assess whether your cat is\n",
    "having a hard time urinating. If you see your cat straining while trying to urinate, or spending a long time trying\n",
    "with no result, take your cat to the vet immediately. Male cats in particular can develop urinary conditions where\n",
    "the urethra (the tube from the bladder to the penis) narrows or gets blocked. Typically small amounts of urine can\n",
    "pass until the cat is completely blocked and cannot urinate at all. This is a life threatening situation and needs\n",
    "immediate medical care. Blockages can also occur in the intestinal tract. Some cats with a urinary infection or\n",

    "lead to chronic issues requiring special diets and laxatives. Diarrhea is not uncommon either, including chronic\n",
